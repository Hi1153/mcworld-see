# Minecraft World Viewer 3D

A static GitHub Pages prototype for visualizing Minecraft Bedrock `.mcworld` files in the browser.

## Publish on GitHub Pages

1. Upload `index.html`, `style.css`, `main.js`, and `README.md` to the root of `Hi1153/mcworld-3d-viewer`.
2. Open **Settings → Pages**.
3. Under **Build and deployment**, choose **Deploy from a branch**.
4. Choose branch `main` and folder `/(root)`, then Save.
5. Open `https://hi1153.github.io/mcworld-3d-viewer/` after deployment completes.

## Notes

- Runs in the browser; selected world data is not uploaded to a server by this app.
- Uses `mcbe-leveldb-reader` to read LevelDB keys and Three.js to render blocks.
- Initial prototype supports Bedrock persistent subchunk formats 8 and 9 and renders the Overworld. Legacy formats and some special cases are not supported yet.
- There is no artificial subchunk or rendered-block cap. Very large worlds are limited by the available memory and GPU resources of the device. The viewer builds visible block faces per subchunk rather than drawing full cubes for every block.
- Block colors are approximations based on block names, not the official Minecraft textures.
- External ES modules are loaded from esm.sh, so the browser needs internet access.
